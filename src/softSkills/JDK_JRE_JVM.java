    What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
JVM
JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides
the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification
which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been
provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform
dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class. There
are three notions of
the
 JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.
JRE
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java
Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java
applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of
JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at
runtime.
JDK
JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It is a software development environment
which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains
JRE + development tools. JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java
Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:
o
Standard Edition Java Platform
o
Enterprise Edition Java Platform
o
Micro Edition Java Platform
JDK, JRE and JVM?
• Java Virtual Machine: JVM is an abstract machine. It actually runs by Java code. Most
people know Java with this slogan "Write once and run everywhere' This slogan is
because of JVM.
• Java Runtime Environment : JRE is what we need to run a Java program and contains
set of libraries and other files that JVM uses at run time. JRE = JVM + Library Classes
• Java Development Kit : JDK is what we need to compile Java source code and
contains JRE, development tools. JDK = JRE + Development tools
