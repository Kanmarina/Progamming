1) What is Automation testing?
        Automation Testing is a technique using an automation tool to write and execute tester's test scripts and cases.
        Use automation testing tool to execute your test case and compare expected and actual result then generate detail test report.
        • The process of performing testing automatically which reduces the human intervention this is automation testing.
        • In automation testing we use a tool that runs the test script to test the application; this test script can be generated manually or automatically. When testing is completed then tools automatically generate the test report and report

        2. Goal
        The goal of automation is reduce the number of test cases to be run manually.

        3.
        Why automated testing ?

        ❖manual testing of all functionalities, all negative scenarios is time and money consuming
        ❖Automation increase speed of test execution
        ❖Automation helps to increase test coverage



        Improve quality

        regression
        When will you automate? • If it is taking a lot of manual effort. I run at least once manual and after that I automate it. • Automation is good for most repetitive functionality
        82. When do you choose automated testing over manual testing? • If the test cases are high priority test cases. • If the functionality is critical functionality. • Shakeout or smoke-test test cases. • If the test cases are too long and too difficult to execute. The regression test cases based on the priority. • We should automate as much as possible.



        4. Which test cases to automate ?
        ❖High risk business critical test case
        ❖Test cases that are repeatedly executed
        ❖Test cases that are very difficult to perform manually
        ❖Test cases which are very time consuming
        ❖Test cases which are part of smoke test
        ❖
        What things can you automate?

        Group of answer choices

        Regression test suite

        Smoke / Sanity test suite

        Test data creation

        Automating behind the GUI like testing of APIs and methods
        138. What tests can be automated? • Regression tests • Smoke tests • Functional tests • API • Database



        5. Which tests cannot be automate
        ❖Test cases that are Newly designed and not executed manually at least once
        ❖Test cases for which the requirements are frequently changing
        ❖Test cases which are require more human interaction
        ❖Test cases which related to capture content of the image
        ❖Test case which for “one time testing”
        139. When will you NOT automate? • If functionality keeps changing • If functionality is used only once during the entire project • Ad-hoc test cannot be automated.
        .When will you not automate testing?
        When the Application Under Test changes frequently
        100% automation would be difficult to achieve because there would be many edge test cases and some cases that are executed seldom. Automating these cases which are not executed that often will not add value to the automated suite.




        6 What are the advantages of using the Test Automation Framework?
        Saves time and money. Automation testing is faster in execution

        Reusability of code. Create one time and execute multiple times with less or no maintenance

        Easy reporting. It generates automatic reports after test execution

        Easy for compatibility testing. It enables parallel execution in combination of different OS and browser environments

        It is mostly used for regression testing. Supports execution of repeated test cases
