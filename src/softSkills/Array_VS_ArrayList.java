public class Array_VS_ArrayList {
    /*
    1.The biggest differences Array and ArrayList is length.
    Array is fixed size data structure , which means we cannot to
    change after create, we cannot remove or add any elements;

    AL has variable size, and it can be change dynamically.
    Which mean we can add and remove any elements.

    2. The Array can store Primitive and object,
     but ArrayList can support only Objects and Generics,
     for work AL with primitive types we should use wrapper ;

   3) they have different methods for calculate length.
    Array provides length of Array while ArrayList provides size().

   6) One more difference on Array vs ArrayList is that you can
   create ArrayList without specifying size,
   which mean Array List will have default size.
   but we should to provide size of Array while creating the new Array.
    Directly or indirectly by initializing Array while creating it.
 By the way you can also initialize ArrayList while creating it.
