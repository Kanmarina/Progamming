All the rules of of the constructor:
Constructor: special method. belongs to the object.
used when we create the objects of the class
1.  Every class MUST have constructor.(if there isn't any, compiler will give no-arg constructor by default)
2.  Constructor method cannot have return-types or specifiers
return-types: primitives, wrapper class, objects,...
specifiers: final, static, abstract
3.  Constructor' name MUST be same with the ClassName
4.  constructor' execution depends on the creation of the object
5.  constructor can only be called in other constructor.( methods or blocks cannot call constructor)6.  constructor cannot be called by constructor-name, MUST be called with this or super keywordthis(): calls the class' constructorsuper(): calls the super class' constructor
7.  constructor cannot call or contain itself
8.  constructor cannot call more than one constructor
9.  constructor call MUST be the first step
10.  class' object MUST be created with existing and visible constructor(s)
11.  super class' default constructor (no-arg) is called in sub class' constructor(any constructor) by default
12.  at least one of the super class' constructors MUST be called in sub class
13.  Constructor can be overload
